# OCT
A software OCT (Orientation Computing Tool) computes the local orientations of a geological contact using Delaunay triangulation. This code is related to the following paper accepted for publication in Computers&Geosciences:
"Using Delaunay triangulation and cluster analysis to determine the orientation of a sub-horizontal and noise including contact in Krak√≥w-Silesian Homocline, Poland". The code was written in C++. For more information, see the UserManual.

# Instruction

## 1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio and CGAL library. The instructions with CGAL installation can be found here:

https://www.cgal.org/download/windows.html

Alternatively, you can contact Michal Michalak and ask for an executable. KYC and AML procedures will be applied ü§§

## 2. Prepare your input data in the following format:

Example 1.
X | Y| Z | id
--- | --- | --- | ---
| 919016.62 | 254566.13 | 196.04 | 1 |
| 919027.75 | 252559.20 | 237.19 | 2 |
| 919042.29 | 253658.44 | 231.49 | 3 |
| 919081.62 | 253445.45 | 234.78 | 4 |
| 919094.57 | 253812.40 | 227.02 | 5 |

Example 2.
X | Y| Z1 | Z2 | id
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| 919016.62 | 254566.13 | 196.04 | 189.09 | 1 |
| 919027.75 | 252559.20 | 237.19 | 121.30 | 2 |
| 919042.29 | 253658.44 | 231.49 | 201.11 | 3 |
| 919081.62 | 253445.45 | 234.78 | 211.98 | 4 |
| 919094.57 | 253812.40 | 227.02 | 234.30 | 5 |



Note:

- X corresponds to latitude, Y corresponds to longitude, Z corresponds to elevation, id corresponds to the number of point
- the first example contains one surface and the second example contains two surfaces
- the above set contains five boreholes, each defined by XYZ coordinates
- the last column must be the index
- the Cartesian coordinates XYZ are separated by space
- the use of decimal point within a coordinate is allowed
- remove header (X Y Z id) prior to executing the program
- the file should be saved as .txt


## 3. Open Microsoft Visual Studio, paste the code (SourceCode) and run it.

- Specify the number of input surfaces
  
- Specify the path of your input data and press ENTER. The following format should be applied:
C:\dev\CGAL-4.8\examples\Triangulation_2\JurassicBottomInput.txt

- Specify the path of the output and press ENTER. The following format should be applied:
C:\dev\CGAL-4.8\examples\Triangulation_2\JurassicBottomOutput.txt

- Specify the density of the regular grid (the distance of separation between points). If you are not interested in a regular version of the map, you can enter a big number such as 10000

## 4. Your output files are ready for further processing including .vtu files for ParaView.
